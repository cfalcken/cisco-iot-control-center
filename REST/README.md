# Scripts for using the Control Center REST API

These scripts use the officially documented REST API of the Cisco IOT Control Center Solution. Key functions include an easy way to process any arguments, reading site and user specific information from an external file ("$HOME/settings.yaml" or as specified in environment variable CCSETTINGS), and the ability to read all pages until the last page is reached.
