# Security Policy

This repository includes only a selection of small sample scripts to get you started with building your own API applications for accessing Control Center. 
Please make sure that you consider the security aspects of your applications, such as not saving your API keys within the scripts and securing the
settings file.

If you have any concerns about the security of the scripts and want to suggest an enhancement, please send an email to cfalcken@cisco.com
